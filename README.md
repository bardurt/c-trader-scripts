## 1 - Fair Value Gap
The Fair Value Gap indicator is based on concepts by <b>Michael J. Huddleston</b> - https://www.youtube.com/c/InnerCircleTrader. It is a 3 bar pattern, bar 1, 2 and 3, where bar 1 and 3 do not intersect eachother. This forms a Fair Value Gap in bar 2 in the space between bar 1 and 3.
